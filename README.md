# A Simple Guessing Game

### Gameplay
The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100. The user makes a series of guesses. For each guess, the computer gives feedback to the user on whether or not the guess was:
* below the lower bound (1)
* above the upper bound (100)
* lower than the random number
* higher than the random number
* equal to the random number

In the case where the user guesses the random number, the computer let's the user know how many guesses it took. The user is then given the option to play again or view a history of past games.
